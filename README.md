# ⚡ VibeCheck: The AI Bestie for Students
> **Vibe:** 100% Chill

## 🍵 What's the Tea? (The Problem)
Let's be real—being a student right now is **stressful**.
Between JEE/NEET prep, board exams, parental pressure, and trying to have a life, things get heavy. But going to a "counselor" feels too serious, and venting to friends can be awkward because they are stressed too.
We need a safe space to just **let it out** without getting a lecture.

## 💡 The Solution: VibeCheck
**VibeCheck** is an anonymous AI companion built for Indian students. It’s not a doctor or a therapist—it’s just a non-judgmental friend who listens.
It uses **Llama 3 (via Groq)** to chat instantly in **Hinglish**, so it actually understands when you say *"Bohot stress hai yaar."*

### 🔥 Features (No Cap)
- **Ghost Mode 👻:** No login. No email. No database. Your chat history disappears the second you close the tab.
- **Hinglish Native 🇮🇳:** Speaks your language (Hindi + English mix).
- **Speed ⚡:** Powered by Groq's LPU, so replies are literally instant.
- **Safety Net 🛡️:** If things get too dark (self-harm/crisis), it stops the act and guides you to real help immediately.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
Built with ❤️ and late-night caffeine:
-   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glassmorphism UI ✨), Vanilla JS.
-   **AI Brain:** Groq Cloud API (Running Llama 3.3 70B Versatile).
-   **Design:** Modern Aurora Gradients & Responsive Flexbox.
